# OpenHomeProject
The Open Home project is a collaborative effort to develop and implement strategies for providing affordable housing and supportive services that improve community resilience. Weâ€™re a group of designers, researchers, educators, builders, advocates, artists, students, and community members working together to consolidate, generate, and apply knowledge.
