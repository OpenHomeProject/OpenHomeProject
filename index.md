# Open Home Project

## Welcome!
You’ve found your way to the Open Home Project. We’re glad you’re here! 

## What is the Open Home Project?
The Open Home project is a collaborative effort to develop and implement strategies for providing affordable housing and supportive services that improve community resilience. We’re a group of designers, researchers, educators, builders, advocates, artists, students, and community members working together to consolidate, generate, and apply knowledge. All of the research, ideas, and designs you see here will be released under a Creative Commons license when we open the project up to the greater world. 

## What are we currently working on?
We’re asking a lot of questions, trying to define what we need to know, and exploring how we work together in a way that invites collaboration and is easy for new contributors to engage with. A number of contributors are also piloting methods for improving the experience and performance of existing transitional housing through landscape design at tiny-home villages in the PNW.

## Where are we headed?
In the near future, we plan on pursuing public funding to develop prototype modular housing units for deployment in various contexts across the Pacific Northwest. Were starting with three archetypes: individual units which can be deployed in suburban settings as ADUs or used to replace/upgrade mobile homes, cottage-cluster developments in urban environments, and larger housing developments in areas with limited infrastructure such as rural regions and places affected by natural disasters. We’re particularly interested in exploring how energy, water, and sanitation infrastructure can be efficiently incorporated into each type of application. 

## How can you get involved?
Good question! We're still trying to figure out how this all works. For now, shoot us an email if you'd like to get involved and we'll reply as fast as we can. We've also got a set of [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NaMTLAzolAIyWQQMRYi9i32xsYqiwWHu2UPG764IWzc/edit#heading=h.ep7tyqn7d78m) that we're trying to transition away from, but will provide a bit of background if you want to know more.
